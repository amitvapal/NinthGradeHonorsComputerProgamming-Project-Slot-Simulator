# Project Name: Slot Simulator
User starts with 10 total credits. Bet a number between 1 to 10 credits. If the two of the three Images in slot are same, user wins the amount of credits that user bets thus increasing total credits and vice a verse.
### Prerequisites
Following Software tools used to build game “Slot Simulator”
Python 3.7.1
Pygame 1.9.6

## Running the tests
Once the program is executed, you would see simulated slot machine with total starting credits 10. 





Bets start with default 1 credit. Press keyboard arrow keys to increase or decrease bet credits. Lets bet for 4 credits and then press enter 




















 Wow! , we got two slots with “orange” pictures. We won 4 credits. Now total credits increased to 14.  










On the other hand, if all slots show different pictures, we lose. Total points reduced to 6













Say we bet again for 6













 Alas! We lost six credits again. Gave over




To keep playing. Restart the game.
