# Project Name: Slot Simulator
User starts with 10 total credits. Bet a number between 1 to 10 credits. If the two of the three Images in slot are same, user wins the amount of credits that user bets thus increasing total credits and vice a verse.
### Prerequisites
Following Software tools used to build game “Slot Simulator”
Python 3.7.1
Pygame 1.9.6
Wing Editor 7.1.0.2

## Running the tests
1. Once the program is executed, you would see simulated slot machine with total starting credits 10.

 Wow! , we got two slots with “orange” pictures. We won 4 credits. Now total credits increased to 14.

On the other hand, if all slots show different pictures, we lose. Total points reduced to 6

Say we bet again for 6
